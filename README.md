# Weather_WebApp

A small web-app that uses APIs to generate Weather Forecast. 

<br><br> 
This is a weather web app made purely from HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. It uses certain APIs from the OpenWeatherMap website to display the weather forecast. The site needs permission to access location to display weather in your area but user can also manually add a location of their own choice in the search box to get the weather forecast of that place.

<br><br> 
Apart from giving the current weather details it also gives a detailed hourly forecast as well as five-day forecast. <br><br> This web app is supported in all devices.
